<h2><u>Short Summary</u></h2>

	<p>Being a Chinese minority of Mongolian descent, I grew up in a city surrounded by mountains in western China. I enjoyed reading, fancying the adventure of Harry Potter, obsessed with overcoming obstacles with courage and helping others. My father took me to the United States to study at an elementary school for a year  in Atlanta, Georgia. I moved to Canada for secondary school when I was 14. In this new continent, I had to face the challenge of cultural differences. After taking to drawing, I love to share with others what was in my heart and mind, I became more outgoing, and my enthusiasm helped me make many friends. </p>

	<p>Throughout 2020 to the present, I was alone in Toronto while my parents were fighting against the pandemic in China since my mom is a medical doctor. The inconvenience of quarantine was frustrating, and the situation made me anxious. Due to this, my mother suggested I commit myself to drawing again, creating entertaining posters related to propagating Coronavirus prevention knowledge. My drawings encouraged my classmates both in Canada and China as I felt proud when seeing their smiling faces. As time went on, I also achieved accomplishments in various aspects such as receiving academic awards, 2-year-learning of piano lessons, participated in math competitions, and completed over 80 hours of volunteering in the community. </p>

	<p>Concept design requires strong imagination and a solid rigorous logical thinking ability in order to achieve an innovative and vivid visual experience. I was fascinated by the magic of results combining traditional drawing and digital techniques. However, the learning process is filled with twists and turns, as it is challenging to manipulate various computer software and confront the self-doubt of designs with the pressure of applying for college. </p>

	<p>Although it has countless challenges ahead, I will always follow my heart, being persistent in the field I have strong passion for, and devote my body and soul to the pursuit of creating designs. The over 40-hour-practice time each week, editing drawings on tablets from dusk to dawn, the friendship between my friends always reminded me to keep going forward, all these moments I want to cherish. </p>

	<p>Like Hogwarts was a dream for Harry Potter, going into college and the entertainment industry is my dream routine to grow and develop. I hope to countinue enjoying the experience exploring the fantasies of art and design in college and the rest of my life.</p>
